# Abstract
## Requirements 
An abstract is a one-paragraph summary of your project. Yours should be written at a level that someone with a college degree – although not necessarily in science – can understand  
● Length: less than 300 words (less than 150 for your poster)  
● Format: Word docs are preferable (easier to provide feedback) for drafts. Submit your final abstracts as a PDF file.

## Original Project Abstract
Original Project Abstract
This project aims to contribute novel applications and methods to KBase by creating a KBase module and its reports. KBase is the Department of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase, an open source project enabling collaborative bioinformatics data processing and supporting reproducible science. KBase and its software development kit, kb_sdk, is comprehensively documented, but given its vast capabilities, it is difficult to learn in isolation. Interns will be given one-on-one mentorship and guidance through the technologies required for these contributions, including Docker, JavaScript, POSIX shell, Python and React as well as internal KBase APIs. Moreover, this project will serve as a testbed for a new KBase module template that will accelerate KBase app development. This template will enable fast iteration and creation of new base KBase modules for KBase Science Focus Area partners, and other KBase developers. This will involve resolving technical issues to support common use cases such as, downloading, uploading and managing provenance for data from the KBase workspace, as well as creating highly interactive reports. Interns will document and present system design principles used in the project for KBase developers. This project is intended to be completed on-site.

his project aims to contribute novel applications and methods to KBase by creating a KBase module and its reports. KBase is the Department of Enegery Systems Biology Knowledgebase(KBase), an open source project enabling collaborative bioinformatics data processing and supporting reproducible science. There are many different components that comprise of KBase. KBase consists of narratives, apps, and modules
