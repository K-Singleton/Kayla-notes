# Abstract
## Requirements 
An abstract is a one-paragraph summary of your project. Yours should be written at a level that someone with a college degree – although not necessarily in science – can understand  
● Length: less than 300 words (less than 150 for your poster)  
● Format: Word docs are preferable (easier to provide feedback) for drafts. Submit your final abstracts as a PDF file.

## Original Project Abstract
Original Project Abstract
This project aims to contribute novel applications and methods to KBase by creating a KBase module and its reports. KBase is the Department of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase, an open source project enabling collaborative bioinformatics data processing and supporting reproducible science. KBase and its software development kit, kb_sdk, is comprehensively documented, but given its vast capabilities, it is difficult to learn in isolation. Interns will be given one-on-one mentorship and guidance through the technologies required for these contributions, including Docker, JavaScript, POSIX shell, Python and React as well as internal KBase APIs. Moreover, this project will serve as a testbed for a new KBase module template that will accelerate KBase app development. This template will enable fast iteration and creation of new base KBase modules for KBase Science Focus Area partners, and other KBase developers. This will involve resolving technical issues to support common use cases such as, downloading, uploading and managing provenance for data from the KBase workspace, as well as creating highly interactive reports. Interns will document and present system design principles used in the project for KBase developers. This project is intended to be completed on-site.

<font size ="3">Introduction (what is the greater context? Why you are doing this work?):</font> 

KBase is the Department of Energy Systems Biology Knowlegebase(KBase). KBase is an open source project enabling collaborative bioinformatics data processing and supporting reproducible science. There are many different components that comprise of KBase. KBase consists of narratives, apps, and modules. KBase narratives are notebooks used for analysis that are easily accessible by browser. The KBase apps are tools that scientists can use to assist in the analyzing of their data. Developers use the KBase Software Development Kit(SDK) who then make the source code for the modules which contain the apps.

In this project, I will be using a large language model similar to Chat GPT to create a KBase SDK virtual assistant. This project aims to improve the access to information such as the KBase SDK to make the process of creating modules more effortless. I will be developing this project using various programs such as Docker, JavaScript, POSIX shell, Python, React, and the internal KBase APIs on my computer via Visual Studio(VS) code located in the Computational Science Initiative(CSI) at Brookhaven National Laboratory(BNL). [This is where I discuss more about the different tools I will be using.]

<font size ="3">Impact(s) or relevance(of your work on the BNL mission, a BNL researchprogram, and/or a DOE program(s) or mission):</font>    

The work of KBase is relevant to the Department of Energy’s mission driving of force of collaboration between DOE scientists and working to improve the speed of scientific discovery.
